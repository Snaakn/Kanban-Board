# todolist
This is my learning project for Vue 3 in Vite.
I wanted to make a todo list app and it turned out to become a kanban board using vuedraggable@next and state management with Pinia.

Currently it is only the front end for learning Vue. Later I want to build a backend as well using Spring Boot
